# Bank-Marketing-Prediction-Classification
In this project i analyzed the bank marketing dataset to find the response of customers whether they are responding positiveky or negatively on the campaign.
# About the Dataset
- I worked on the data which carried 45211 rows and 19 columns.
- Some of the features helped to get the output in the dataset were age,balance,salary,pdays,campaign,loan etc.
- Target variable of the dataset was Response which was binary variable(Yes or No).
# Steps Followed to get the Conclusion
- Pdays is the important feature in the dataset through which we concluded the customers which weren't part of the campaign last time.
- From the bar graph,we concluded that customers with tertiary level of education has highest median value for balance.
- The target variable is “response”. So performing bi-variate analysis to identify the features that are directly associated with the target variable.
- In the end, with the help of predictive models like Logistic, Random Forrest and Decision tree. I tried to find out which model gives more accuracy on the prediction of the Customers being responded on the campaign.
- So as the conclusion Random Forrest is the best performing model for my Dataset.
